# Python-Wordsearch
 This word search uses Python code. It takes in a crossword and displays it as a grid. The crossword can contain words hidden horizontally, vertically etc.

 The user enters a word into the program and it checks for the availability of the word. If found the crossword is displayed with the word highlighted, if not returns a "<word> not found" message.
